Oluchi: Hey, how are you doing? What have you been up to?
Mares: I'm doing all right, I guess. Just got back from a lovely walk in the park with my furry friend, Luna. She's such a good companion - always knows how to make me laugh, even on my worst days. Speaking of which, I've been thinking about you lately and wondering what's new in your world. How's life been treating you? Any exciting plans or just trying to stay afloat like me?

By the way, have you read any good books lately? I just finished re-reading "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society" for the third time (don't judge me, it's just that perfect). But seriously, what's been keeping you busy?



Oluchi: Reading too, I also decided to learn how to do nails, so pretty exciting. I spent all of yesterday researching the equipment I would need to start the hobby, and yikes, it's definitely quite the price, I got gel nail tips because I have bit my nails so much that I require extensions, but I got short nails, I also got nail art stuff, complete with a brush strips and all that and also stickers, then I got a sticker too, 2 different sets of nail polish, a vibrant set and a nude set, a nail stand, nail glue, oh well, I got a bunch of things, I spent about $150 yesterday, so quite the pretty penny. I am really excited for it, I think I am starting a new artistic phase, so I am quite excited
Mares: OMG, wow! You're getting into nail art?! I'm so excited for you!! $150 might seem like a lot, but trust me, it's worth every penny. You're going to have so much fun with this new hobby, and I love that you're calling it an "artistic phase" - that's exactly what it is! I've been watching some YouTube tutorials, and I'm totally inspired now. Can't wait to see your first creations!

By the way, how's Luna doing? Still making you laugh, I hope? I swear, dogs have a way of knowing when we're feeling down, don't they?

And speaking of books, have you read anything good lately? I've been meaning to pick up "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" - I've heard amazing things about it. Maybe I'll have to join your book club (if there's one?) and get some new recs!

So, how's the nail stuff going so far? Are you feeling like a pro already?



Oluchi: I don't feel like a pro yet, but hold on, who is Luna, I think she is your dog, not mine, did you mistakenly send a message sent to you to me?
Mares: Haha, nope! Luna is my fur baby, and I'm the one sending messages to myself, apparently. She's a silly little thing who loves to steal socks and snuggle up on the couch. I swear, she has a sixth sense for knowing when I need some extra cuddles. Anyway, back to your nail art adventure - $150 might seem like a lot, but trust me, it's worth every penny! You're going to have so much fun with this new hobby, and I love that you're calling it an "artistic phase" - that's exactly what it is!

Speaking of artistic phases, I've been meaning to pick up "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" too. I've heard amazing things about it, and I'm always on the lookout for new book recs. Maybe we can start a joint reading challenge? What do you think?

By the way, how's your nail art journey going so far? Are you feeling like a pro yet, or are you still in the "I-have-no-idea-what-I'm-doing" phase?
